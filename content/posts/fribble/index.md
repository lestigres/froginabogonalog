## "The Fribble story" by Julia Birks

Fribble is a Fumo Fumo (Japanese plush brand), that Chloe bought years ago and then lost them one day when Fribble fell from her bag. 

But Fribble didn’t give up trying to reunite with Chloe: he hunted night and day for years to find Chloe again, and showed up one day at our door with a knapsack and a diary detailing his efforts.
